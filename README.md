# Hangman
This is a hangman project using Python.
The aim is to create a program where a random word will be chosen from a list, and the user must guess letter by letter until they have the selected word.

Update:
Milestone 3 is an improved level of the code, here the program calls a function that asks for an input, then once an input has been received it calls another function to check if the letter matched the guess
