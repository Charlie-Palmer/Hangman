# Hangman
This is a hangman project using Python.
The aim is to create a program where a random word will be chosen from a list, and the user must guess letter by letter until they have the selected word.

Update:
Milestone 3 is an improved level of the code, here the program calls a function that asks for an input, then once an input has been received it calls another function to check if the letter matched the guess

Update:
Milestone 4 gives a further improved experience in which all guesses will be passed into a list so user can see what they have already guessed, then if the guess is in the word it will add it to a list of correct letters guessed, and reduce number of remaining letters to guess. If the guess is incorrect it will reduce number of lives by 1 and print a message telling the user how many lives left.
